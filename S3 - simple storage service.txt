S3 - simple storage service

=====================

Amazon S3 is scalable , highly avilaible , durable and secure service.


s3 is used for storage purpose and it is a object based storage.
we can store flat files in S3 and can upload, download ,access files from s3.
we cannot execute s3 files and we cannot install any s/w in S3.
S3 providing unlimited storage and we cant attach S3 to Ec2 Instance.

we can access S3 objects in Ec2 and S3 support static web hosting.
S3 is serverless and will store data in buckets ,bucket is a container.
bucket contains objects( files).
S3 is a global but buckets are regional.
S3 bucket name should be Unique
note: always create bucket name with company name or project name.
we cannot create one bucket inside another bucket.
we can create multiple buckets in multiple regions.
max we can create 100buckets in S3(soft limit)
By default buckets are private, if required we can make it public.
every bucket wil have its onw URL/endpoint.


what are Storage classes:
====================
Standared frequently Access (FA)  --> if you need access frequently then go for FA access to store data.

standared infrequently access (IA)  --> i want to access data rarely /montly once then go for IA.

reduced REdundnacy Storage (RRS)
one Zone IA
Intelligent Tiering  --> if i dont know my access pattern then i will go for this pattern.

Glacier  historical data for archival purpose/old data.

Max capacity of Object ---> 5TB you can upload
at a time you can upload data upto 5 GB.

end point : Unique URL generated every object.
if it is public any one can access else if its private, then only object owner can access.


Versioning : versioning we will enable at bucket level, then it will apply objects ailiable in the bucket.
once bucket is enable , we cant disable , we can only suspend it.

differntiate between old and new files

Delete marker : when the original file is deleted , delete marker will generate.

How to restore orignial file : by using delete marker.

by default versioing is not enabled in s3, we hae to enable manually. 

Transfer Acceleration: to speed up content data  provided by AWS.

presigned URL : Url will be avilaibe for limited period time.


Encription: to secure data

by using life cycle we can store object one storage class to another storage class.

CRR & SRR

if you want to replicate the data in cross region we can go for CRR.

if you want to replicate the data in same region we can go for SRR    .

object Lock :- store objects using a write once read many(WORM) model to help you prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time.

if you enable your bucket using object lock..no one can delete your bucket.


Amzon s3 having 3 types of encryptions
=================================

server side encryption -aws is responsible
client side encryption - client is responsible
in-transit encryption - while data moving -https


static website hosting using S3
=================================

1.create a bucket in s3. --bucket name: ashokit.org

- uncheck block public acccess 

2. goto Bucket  -> click on permissions---> edit policy and configure below policy for bucket.

{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement":[
{
"Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": [ "s3:GetObject"],
"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::ashokit.org/*"]
}]}

3. goto objects --> upload static website files 
4. go to bucket properties and chooze "Static website hosting"

5. it will ddisplay URL, access that URL
