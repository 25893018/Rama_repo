static Pods:
  ==========
static pods directly managed by Kubelet.

Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them. 
Unlike Pods that are managed by the control plane (for example, a Deployment); instead, 
the kubelet watches each static Pod (and restarts it if it fails).

Static Pods are always bound to one Kubelet on a specific node.

The kubelet automatically tries to create a mirror Pod on the Kubernetes API server for each static Pod. 
This means that the Pods running on a node are visible on the API server, but cannot be controlled from there. 
The Pod names will be suffixed with the node hostname with a leading hyphen.

Note: If you are running clustered Kubernetes and are using static Pods to run a Pod on every node, you should probably be using a DaemonSet instead.
Note: The spec of a static Pod cannot refer to other API objects (e.g., ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, Secret, etc).
Note: Static pods do not support ephemeral containers.

 login to any worker node instance:
 kubectl get nodes
systemctl status kubelet  --> to see status of kubelet

 cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests
 ls -lrt
 
 sudo vi static_pod.yaml
 
 apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name:my-static_ pod
spec:

containers:
   restartPolicy: Never   
  - name: mybusybox
  image: busybox
 
  
 when you save static_pod.yaml file in backend/on node static pod automatically
 create with suffix name.
 
 * statically created pod in worker node is called static pod and this is managed 
 by kubelet.
 
 * same pod it will show/auomatically create and that is point to static node 
 you when you use command called
 kubectl get pods --> this is called mirror pod and maanaged by API server.
 
 
 please note static pods we cannot remove normallay . insted you can go where you created
 yaml file to create pod there you can go and remove pod, else you cant remove any where
 
sudo rm -rf  my-static_pod

$ kubectl get pods -n kube-systems --> to see static pod details:

rollout and rollback and automatic pod up..these type of different configration features not work for static pods
