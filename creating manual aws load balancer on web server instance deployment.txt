=================
To launch Web server:

webserver is used to run web application
in EC2 we will install web server to run web applications.

create Ec2 instance

whoami 
pwd
sudo su
 
sudo yum update -y 

suod yum install -y apache2
or
sudo yum install -y httpd
yum info httpd


both are web servers you can install any one


sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd



cd /var/www/html

sudo touch index.html
sudo chmod 777 index.html
sudo cat > index.html
this is rama login to AWS

=============
this entire above process is called website deployement into server.

********create an another instance using above steps for webserver2 instance 

to check load balancing .

our website is running on one server
everybody sending same request to same server 
load will increase on server
if load increases might server get crash

to overcome this problem we have to reduce burden on server
to reduce burden on the server we have to distribute the load
to distribute the load we will use *****Load balancer- ELB
======================================================


create Load balancer and attach above two web server instaces attach to ELB

use DNS domain name to check load balancing working or not

if you are getting error, please check inbound rules.
