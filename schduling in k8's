  Advanced K8's Schduling:*************************************************
  =======================================================
  how schduling works in K8's.
  
  manually schduling pods on diff nodes
  nodeName
  nodeSelector
  podAffnity/anti-Affinity
  node affinity and Anti Affinity
  Node taints and Pod Tolrations
  =========
  nodeName
  ==========
  if you want to schdule/create any pod manually then we can go for advanced
  schduling.
  
  you can create pod on particualr node manullay using below methods. thse are
  advanced schduling methods in k8's.
  
  ====nodeName  - -> if you dont mention in yaml file nodeName then by default 
  schduler will come picture and deploy node where its required.
  
  ***thorugh command can write yaml file using below command:
  
  kubectl run nginx-manual-sche --image nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > manschdule.yaml
  
 vi manschdule.yaml
 
 apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
labels: 
run: nginx-manual-sche
name:nginx-manual-sche
spec:
nodeName:node id name what you want here copy and paste

containers:  
  - image: nginx
  name: nginx-manual-sche
  
  kubectl apply -f manschdule.yaml
  
  if you want to see more details about pod you can use describe command
  
  kubectl describe pod podname
  
  Note: nodeName always should be assgined in Prod sepeciation.
  
  
  ===================================
 
  nodeSelector
  podAffnity/anti-Affinity
  node affinity and Anti Affinity
  Node taints and Pod Tolrations
  
  
  Adv Pod schduling with node affinity and Anti Affinity
  
  understanding Node Taints and Pod Tolrations 
  understanding INIT- containers
  understanding of DaemonSets
  
   first check
   kubectl get nodes 
   kubectl run nginx --image nginx --check now where it is creating/which node
   
   kubectl get pods nginx -o yaml --> it will show you create default node/pod details
   default it will assign node name to the pod when you run image. this is responsible
   for schduler and it works on based on algorthims.
